# Tinker: Open-Source Bipedal Robot

**Tinker** is an open-source bipedal robot designed to provide robotic enthusiasts and developers with a hands-on platform. This project includes a detailed list of required hardware materials, software resources, and comprehensive installation steps to help users easily build and program their own robot.

Through Tinker, users will not only gain insights into the fundamental principles of robot movement and control, but also have the opportunity to personalize and enhance their projects. We aim to inspire more people to explore and engage with robotics technology through this initiative.
